# this was done in Jupiter Notebook
# It's a simple project that uses folium library to get world map and then load volcanoes coordinates from file and mark them on the map
# very easy to use


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import folium as fo
%matplotlib inline


map = fo.Map()  # this is basically a quite detailed map of the world

x = fo.FeatureGroup(name="Map of volcanoes")  # this is an overlayer 

volcano = pd.read_csv("239.volcano.csv")   # dataframe. We need volcano longitude,latitude and name
lat_vo= list(volcano.Latitude)
lon_vo= list(volcano.Longitude)
name_vo= list(volcano.Name)

# we need some method to add markers to map
for lat,lon,name in zip(lat_vo,lon_vo,name_vo):
  x.add_child(fo.Marker(location=[lat,lon],popup=name,icon=fo.Icon(color='red')))
  
map.add_child(x) # add overlay with markers to main map
